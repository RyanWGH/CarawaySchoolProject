## Project Outline

### Background
From their website: 
> "Caraway is an alternative K–9 program with project-based and child-centred
> learning, committed to actively connecting family, school, and society." 
> (Caraway School, 2017) 

The school is divided into classrooms of grouped ages:

Room | Grouped ages
-----|---------------
Blue Room | Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2
Purple Room | Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2
Green Room | Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade 5
Red Room | Grade 6, Grade 7, Grade 8, Grade 9
Grey Room | Grade 9, Grade 10, Grade 11, Grade 12

There is one teacher designated for each classroom. Each classroom has approximately 22-26 students.
There are teacher assistants who help with planning and would need to be able to view the scheduled
facilitators.

There is an Executive Board consisting of nine parents who manages the structure and administration of
the school.

### Facilitation
One of Caraway’s principle philosophies lies in parent involvement. Along with this, parents are
required to offer volunteer time facilitating in the classrooms. This is sometimes done by other family
members or designates of the family. There is a set minimum number of hours per week, per family.
Currently, families with only one child in the school are expected to facilitate a minimum of 2.5
hours/week, and families with 2 or more children are currently required to contribute 5 hours/week.
These numbers are subject to change. This is an essential aspect in the success of the school and the
students.

Board members get an automatic 5 hour facilitation credit per month. They are however still expected
to facilitate through the month.

### Current System 
The current system for tracking facilitation involves Excel document templates for each week, for each
classroom. These are printed and posted to a designated wall
at the school. There are three time slots (morning, lunch & afternoon) and a designated number of ideal
parents for each classroom, for each time slot. Parents preferably sign up in advance so teachers can
plan according the amount of support they have that day. Although most parents facilitate in the
classroom of their children, this is not required. In fact, it’s preferred if parents ensure adequate
facilitation in all rooms by moving when needed. In this regard, it is nice to have a way to track the
facilitation hours per classroom.

Although it’s preferred that parents cover an entire time slot, they are also able to indicate a time range
they were at the school (8:45-10:15am for example). It would be ideal to have a system where parents
could check in/check out of facilitation for accurate tracking. Statistically it would also be nice to track
those situations where families sign up and cancel, or sign up at the time and not prior. Lunch slot time
counts as double time in facilitation hours. Two members of the same family could facilitate in different classrooms (or the same classroom) at the same time, but the same parent could not sign up for the
same time slot in different classrooms (i.e. double book themselves).

Field trip days count as 8 hours and parents that sign up generally commit to the entire day. There are
exceptions of half day fieldtrips or facilitators that only stay for half days, but this is not the norm and
generally discouraged. Field trips often involve multiple
classrooms and/or grades. There are usually a set number of facilitators included with the plan and so
additional parents will be expected to pay for their own entry (if necessary). Teachers or administrators
should be able to set up fieldtrips in the system and indicate these types of parameters.

Currently, because of the relatively manual system for time tracking, the morning slot is counted as 3
hours, lunch as 1 hour (x2) and afternoon as 3 hours. The number of time slots and exact time ranges
are subject to potential change.

Families can indicate if they are on vacation, and therefore exempt from facilitation during that time.
This is only valid if their children are not attending school, and these requests should be subject to
administrative approval. There are other situations that allow families to be exempt from facilitation
hours, including maternity leave (6 weeks).

At the end of each week, the designated facilitation administrator takes home the sheets for the week
and inputs them into an Excel sheet for tracking hours per family. Currently, this is done by manually writing the information into an interim tracking by
hand. Then the data is input into the spreadsheet for tracking
each family’s facilitation hours. Note the spreadsheet is tracked by student name, and there is tracking
hours for the family in general, but there is a place to record all potential facilitators for the family.
There is tracking by week, and statistics calculated by month and year to date. There’s also historical
tracking of hours for families who have been attending the school longer than 1 year.

### Stakeholders
There is usually one person designated in charge of the facilitation tracking system for the school year.

Board members would need to be able to see statistics and perform administrative duties.

Teachers would need their own view in order to see statistics for their classrooms and view the
facilitation schedule for the day.

Parents would need to be able to sign up for facilitation time slots and track their family hours. This
should reset to show them 0 hours at the beginning of each week, but allow for a report of historical
data. It’s important to know which families are completing overall enough hours, but also if families are
completing their minimum hours for each week.

Families can also donate extra hours to other families who haven’t been able to complete their
facilitation. This is done ad hoc by the families.
